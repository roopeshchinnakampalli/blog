### AI Announcements: What’s New for Developers

- **Gemini 2.5 Pro & Flash**
  - The latest Gemini models bring big improvements in code generation, reasoning, and speed.
  - **Deep Think Mode** enables smarter, multi-step reasoning—great for complex logic and code workflows.
  - **Gemini 2.5 Flash** is optimized for fast, efficient coding tasks, with new transparency tools like thought summaries and “thinking budgets” for cost and response control.
  - Both models are available in [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) and [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) (Flash generally available in early June).

- **AI Mode & AI Overviews in Search**
  - Expanded “AI Mode” and “AI Overviews” in Search, now powered by Gemini 2.5.
  - AI Overviews synthesize information from multiple sources, offering direct, AI-generated answers at the top of search results.
  - Available in 200+ countries and 40+ languages, making complex queries easier and faster to answer.

- **Agent-Based Automation (Project Mariner)**
  - Project Mariner introduces hands-free web automation using AI agents that can browse, fill forms, and complete tasks—think of it as building your own web automation bots.

- **Generative Media Models**
  - **Imagen 4 & Stitch:** High-res visuals, accurate text rendering, and prompt-to-code UI generation for rapid UI prototyping.
  - **Veo 3 & Flow:** Turn prompts into cinematic video content, with native audio and editing tools.

- **Gemini API & SDK Updates**
  - Native code editor in Google AI Studio supports Gemini 2.5 Pro for faster prototyping.
  - GenAI SDK enables instant web app generation from text, image, or video prompts.
  - New features: asynchronous function calling, Computer Use API (for building apps that browse or use other tools), and experimental URL context for retrieving page context from links.

- **Native Audio Output & Dialogue**
  - Gemini 2.5 now offers advanced text-to-speech (TTS) for multi-speaker, customizable audio responses—control voice style, accent, and pace.

### Vibe Coding: Live, Collaborative Coding Onstage

- Google showcased “vibe coding” by building productivity apps live at I/O 2025.
  - Example: Google engineers created a to-do list app in real time, showing collaborative, improvisational coding with AI assistance.
  - This approach highlighted how AI tools can speed up prototyping and make coding more interactive and creative.

### Why This Matters for Software Builders

- AI is now deeply integrated into every stage of software development—from prototyping and UI design to automation and deployment.
- Tools like Gemini 2.5, Stitch, and Project Mariner help you build smarter, faster, and more collaboratively.
- The focus on agentic experiences and hands-free automation means you can create applications that act more like intelligent assistants than static tools.
