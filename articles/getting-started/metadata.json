    "content": "<p>I've created this blog to share my thoughts and ideas on AI, technology, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. I'm a software engineer by profession and a tech enthusiast. I'm passionate about building products and developer tools. I'm also a big fan of AI and autonomous vehicles. I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills and learn new things. As a result, I thought it would be a good idea to share my thoughts and ideas with everyone.</p><p>I created this blog using agent mode on Cursor AI, and it took less than a couple of hours. I did not write a single line of code to build this site. I was fascinated by how fast we can get things done. Isn't it cool? Probably this is called vibe coding.</p><p>AI has become an integral part of day-to-day life and is expanding its wings faster than ever. I love playing video games, and I remember I've spent a lot on gaming consoles, but now, we can create a game with just a command. Recently, I created the Road Rash game (which was a childhood favorite) in less than 2 minutes and was able to play it inside the browser. </p><p>My goal for the next few months is to play around with most of the available AI tools and share my thoughts with the world. As I write this article, AI is helping in proofreading this article to check for my grammar and auto-correcting the spelling mistakes and even suggesting writing better content. I promised myself not to use AI to generate some content for this space and will share my thoughts written all by myself.</p><p>Thanks!</p>",
